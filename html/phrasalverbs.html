        <h1>Uncle Bob goes Flat Hunting</h1>
        <div id="storyBox">
            <p>
                I really admire my Uncle Bob, I have always looked up to him as someone I can go for advice.
                What is nice that now and then he comes to me. My Uncle Bob is looking for a new flat. He
                spent the weekend looking through the newspapers trying to find something in his price
                range. He decided he needed some advice so he looked up my phone number in his address
                book and gave me a ring. The next day we spent the afternoon looking at some possibilities
                on the outskirts of San Sebastian, in a suburb called Renteria. He was looking for a bargain
                but I told him to look out for flats which needed a lot of work. doing. In every flat we looked
                over the electrics and the plumbing. All the flats we saw were quite pricey so we looked into
                the possibility of getting a mortgage from the bank. In the end we managed to find the perfect
                flat and Uncle Bob is really looking forward to moving in. It was pricey but I think Uncle BobÂ´ll
                look after it well.
